# Changelog

## 1.0.3 - 2026-05-13

- `run-automation-suite` skill now defaults to the **device-only view URL** (`?view=device-only`) when surfacing the live session link, hiding the surrounding Kobiton UI for a cleaner watch-the-test experience. Falls back to the default view URL only when the user explicitly asks to interact with the device.
- Portal URL mapping in the skill is now derivation-based (`api*.kobiton.com` → `portal*.kobiton.com`) instead of a hard-coded per-env table.

- Improved the accuracy of fetching Appium capabilities supported by Kobiton
- Implemented a reliable method for correlating active sessions with their corresponding device IDs

- Added a user confirmation prompt when selecting an app version for testing
- Enabled Claude to open active test sessions for live screen previews
